# <"Random Password Generator: Easy to use password generator.">

## Description

- What was your motivation? The purpose of this project was to create a password generator that effectively randomizes a password for the user using a variety of numbers, upper/lowercase letters, and symbols. The user is allowed to customize the length of their password (from 8 to 128 characters), and the user is allowed input into which characters they want to use, and do not want to use. The goal of this password generator is for the user to create unique password options for optimal security from hackers.
